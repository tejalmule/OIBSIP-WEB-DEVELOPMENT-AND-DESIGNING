 Introduction

A website is an important digital platform used to provide information and services to users over the internet. In this task, a **responsive travel agency website named “GlobeTrek”** is designed using **HTML for structure** and **CSS for styling and layout**.

 Objective of the Website

The main objective of this website is to:
* Promote travel services and tour packages
* Provide information about popular travel destinations
* Attract customers through modern design and smooth user experience

Use of HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the basic structure of the website.
In this project:

* `<header>` is used for the navigation bar and website name
* `<section>` is used to divide content such as hero section, services, destinations, and testimonials
* `<nav>` is used to create navigation links
* `<img>` tag is used to display destination images
* `<footer>` contains copyright information

HTML helps in organizing content in a meaningful and readable format.

Use of CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to enhance the appearance of the website.
In this project, CSS is used to:

* Apply fonts, colors, spacing, and alignment
* Create a fixed navigation bar
* Design cards using box-shadow and border-radius
* Use Flexbox and Grid for layout management
* Add hover effects and smooth transitions
* Make the website responsive using media queries

Hero Section

The hero section is the first visible part of the website.
It includes:

* A background image related to travel
* A heading, short description, and call-to-action button
  This section attracts user attention and encourages them to explore the website further.

Services Section

This section displays the services provided by the travel agency such as:

* Flight Booking

  Each service is shown inside a card layout for better readability and design.

Destinations Section

The destinations section highlights popular travel locations like Paris, Bali, and New York.
Images and short descriptions are used to visually engage users and inspire travel interest.

Testimonials Section

This section shows customer feedback.
Positive testimonials help in building trust and credibility for the travel agency.

Responsive Design

The website uses **media queries** to adjust font sizes and layout for smaller screens such as mobile devices.
This ensures the website works smoothly on all devices.
