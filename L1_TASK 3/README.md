LEVEL 1 – TASK 3 (Temperature Converter Website)

Title: Design and Development of a Temperature Converter Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Introduction

A temperature converter is a web-based application used to convert temperature values between different units such as **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin**. In this task, a **Temperature Converter website** is developed using **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for performing calculations and displaying results dynamically.

Objective of the Temperature Converter

The main objectives of this project are:

* To accept temperature input from the user
* To convert temperature between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
* To display accurate results instantly
* To understand basic interaction between HTML and JavaScript

Use of HTML

HTML is used to create the structure of the temperature converter interface.
In this project:

* `<input>` tag is used to accept numeric temperature values
* `<select>` tag is used to choose the temperature unit
* `<button>` is used to trigger the conversion process
* `<div>` elements are used to group content and display results

HTML provides a clean and user-friendly layout for the application.

Use of CSS

CSS is used to improve the visual appearance of the temperature converter.
It helps in:

* Centering the converter container
* Styling input fields, dropdown menu, and buttons
* Creating a result box to display output clearly
* Improving readability and user experience

Use of JavaScript

JavaScript is used to add functionality to the website.
The `convertTemp()` function:

* Reads the input temperature value
* Checks the selected temperature unit
* Applies appropriate conversion formulas
* Displays the converted result inside the result box

JavaScript enables real-time calculations without reloading the page.

Working of the Temperature Converter

1. The user enters a temperature value in the input field
2. The user selects the temperature unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin)
3. The user clicks the **Convert** button
4. JavaScript performs the conversion
5. The result is displayed on the screen instantly

Advantages of the Application

* Easy and fast temperature conversion
* User-friendly interface
* Accurate and instant results
* Useful for students and daily use

Conclusion

The Temperature Converter project demonstrates the basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application. It helps in understanding user input handling, conditional logic, and dynamic output display. This project is simple, efficient, and suitable for beginners learning web development.
